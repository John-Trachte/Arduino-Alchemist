# Retired!
**It makes little to no sense for me to try to build something this universal with the level of experience I presently have with C, C++, Arduino, microcontrollers, and electronics in general. Therefore, I've decided to stop development on this project (at least for now) in favor of work that gives me practical experience in these fields and is more beneficial on the whole. This project was a fun exercise and brought some interesting challenges; I would love to see a more complete version, and maye one day I'll make one.**

## Arduino-Alchemist
Optimize code for Aruino microcontrollers by removing use of the Arduino.h library.

Currently supported functions:
	loop()
	digitalWrite()
	pinMode() - partial support (digital pins)
	setup() - partial support (set input/output pins)

In progress functions:
	delay()
	analogWrite()
